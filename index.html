<p>My name is Claudia Rodriguez and I am an FGCU (Florida Gulf Coast University) student. I was born in Cuba and came to the United States when I was one and a half years old. On the picture above, you can see that I play the saxophone; I can also sing, play the piano, and a little bit of the guitar. Although music is my passion and something I love to do, and is a part of me, I have decided to pursue a Math major because I also love math. I love the way you have to figure things out, how you have to think outside the box. Math to me is like a puzzle, the more pieces you have to put together, the more challenging, but when you finally put all the pieces together and see the big picture, all the hard work you went through becomes worth it and you feel accomplished; that's how I feel when I finish solving a very diffiuclt problem, and it makes me want more. I get curious about what the next "level" will be like, and that's what drives me. </p>
